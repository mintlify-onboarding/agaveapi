## User Registration

### Step 1: Invoke Agave Link and Get Access Token

When the end user clicks to login with a 3rd party system, invoke the Agave Link, let them login to the desired system, and get an `account_token`.

### Step 2: Get Email and Account Info

With the `account_token`, you can then call the [/link/account](https://docs.agaveapi.com/reference#tag/link-metadata/operation/getLinkedAccount) endpoint to get email and other metadata like name and company info.

**Request**

```bash
curl https://api.agaveapi.com/link/account \
  --header 'API-Version: 2021-11-21' \
  --header 'Client-Id: your_client_id' \
  --header 'Client-Secret: your_client_secret' \
  --header 'Account-Token: any_of_the_account_tokens'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "account_id": "ee9b53e7-f982-4be6-bc12-75f716d3ee94",
  "linked_company": {
    "id": "ee9b53e7-f982-4be6-bc12-75f716d3ee94",
    "source_id": "12345",
    "name": "Agave construction Inc."
  },
  "linked_user": {
    "id": "ee9b53e7-f982-4be6-bc12-75f716d3ee94",
    "source_id": "12345",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "jsmith@example.com"
  },
  "status": "linked",
  "source_system": {
    "slug": "procore",
    "name": "Procore"
  },
  "supports_cross_account_uuid": true
}
```

### Step 3: Create a New Account

If the email doesn't exist in your database, you can use the account info to create a new account:

- Using `linked_user.email` as email address or username
  -Instead of storing a password, not that it's authenticated via SSO
- Fill-in other data points as needed

### Step 4: Login the User

ðŸŽ‰ Then, you can login the user to the account you just created.

## User Login

Afterwards, when the end user tries to log in again, you can follow step 1 and 2 above.

Then, at step 3, instead of creating a new account, find the existing account in your database by matching `linked_user.email` and log the user in.
